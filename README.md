# Analyzing-Housing-Data
In housing data analysis, I harnessed the power of advanced data analytics tools such as PostgreSQL, Excel, and Power BI. This strategic approach allowed me to uncover valuable insights within a complex dataset, substantially boosting company revenue. By crafting and executing SQL queries with precision, I meticulously constructed a robust dataset for a fresh housing details database, thus elevating the overall accuracy of the data. My efforts culminated in creating aesthetically pleasing Power BI dashboards that illustrated housing market statistics and trends. These visually captivating dashboards played a pivotal role in enabling data-driven decision-making processes.
